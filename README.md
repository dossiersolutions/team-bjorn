## FAQ
### How to deploy latest version to server?

* Push changes to server
* `ruby deploy.rb <OPTIONAL GIT REFSPEC>`

### How does the protocol between thatButton and server look like?
v 1.0.
* buttonId - length: 2 bytes (uint16)
* messageCounter - length: 2 bytes (uint16)
* buttonState - length: 2 bytes (uint16) - value: 0 to 1 (where 0 = unpressed)
* potentiometerState - length: 2 bytes (uint16) - value: 0 to 1023
* potentiometerStep - length: 2 bytes (uint16) - value: 0 to 8

All the numbers are network order, unsigned, 16-bit integers.
